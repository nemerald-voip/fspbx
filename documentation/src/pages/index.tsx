FS PBX replaces that with a streamlined, modern GUI that simplifies management for users who just need to make simple changes.

                'FusionPBX is known to hit performance limits under load, partly due to legacy PHP design (e.g. loading excessive variables into memory). FS PBX’s Laravel backend and optimized codebase eliminate many of these bottlenecks.

In practice, FS PBX has been tested with thousands of endpoints and remains rock-solid.',

While FusionPBX relies on a custom PHP framework, FS PBX leverages Laravel’s mature ecosystem with built-in hardened security features and regular patches. This means fewer vulnerabilities and a quicker response to any issues (thanks to Laravel’s large community). You get enterprise-grade security without the worry that typically comes with smaller projects.',

For example, FS PBX includes an optional Contact Center module with an elegant live dashboard for call queues, and support for STIR/SHAKEN call authentication standards. These enhancements make FS PBX a more feature-rich solution ready for modern VoIP challenges. It takes the best of FusionPBX and builds from there.",

            answer:
                'Both FusionPBX and FS PBX are multi-tenant, but FS PBX has reimagined how multi-tenant is managed. FS PBX uses one central login for all tenants (no need for separate subdomain per tenant) and still ensures complete separation of domains/tenants internally. Resellers can view and jump between their customer domains easily with FS PBX’s admin group controls – a level of reseller-friendly design FusionPBX lacks. Branding is easier as well, since FS PBX was built with white-label in mind from the start.',

            question: 'Active Development & Community',
            answer:
                "FS PBX is a younger project but is under active development. The goal is to eventually eliminate any legacy FusionPBX code that isn’t needed, achieving a fully standalone platform with no compromise. By contrast, FusionPBX’s development, while active, can be slower to adopt modern frameworks. FS PBX’s openness to community contributions and modern coding standards means it can evolve faster in today’s tech landscape.",

                                            FS PBX is designed with VoIP service providers in mind, particularly those needing a white-label PBX solution for their customers. It supports full multi-tenancy, allowing you to host multiple client
                                            PBX instances on a single system – each client (tenant) is completely separated in the database and dial-plan.
                                            Unlike FusionPBX which requires separate domain URLs or awkward username formats for each tenant, FS PBX uses a unified login portal for all tenants.
                                            Users simply log in with their email, and FS PBX intelligently routes them to their correct tenant space

                                            For resellers, FS PBX provides a multi-site admin console: admins can effortlessly switch between different customer domains through a redesigned domain selector.
                                            You can grant resellers access to manage their client accounts all from one master dashboard – no re-login to different URLs required. This architecture makes maintenance easier for providers and gives end-users a smoother experience
