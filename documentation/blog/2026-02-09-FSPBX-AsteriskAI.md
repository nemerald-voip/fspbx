**Features**
- MCP functionality: flight arrival/departure, weather as examples
- call handling: transfer, send email summary, request transcript, leave voicemail
- Interfaces with several AI systems like ChatGPT, Google Deepmind, Claude, and Ollama chat bots

Any questions about handling, should be brought to the maintainer outside of initial configuration which we supply.
