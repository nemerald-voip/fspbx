The FS PBX API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

## Authentication
Use a **Bearer token** to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in **FS PBX Dashboard -> Users**.
All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

## Base path
Use your FS PBX portal URL 

`https://YOUR-FSPBX-HOST/`

All endpoints are rooted at:

`/api/v1`

## Errors
FS PBX uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. 
In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided 
(e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with FS PBX server.

## Pagination

All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches through “list” API methods. For example, you can **list domains**, **list extensions**, and **list voicemails**. 
These list API methods share a common structure and accept, at a minimum, the following three parameters: `limit`, and `starting_after`.

The list API methods use cursor-based pagination through the `starting_after` parameter. This parameter accepts an existing object UUID value and return objects in reverse chronological order. 
It returns objects listed after the named object.
