# Google Cloud

This guide outlines the steps required to configure the Google Cloud Speech-to-Text v2 API for use with the application's voicemail transcription service.

Unlike older API versions that could use a simple API Key, the v2 API requires secure **Service Account authentication (OAuth 2.0)** to access its advanced models and features.

## Prerequisites

*   A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account.

---

## Step 1: Google Cloud Project Setup

Before generating credentials, the project must be configured correctly in the Google Cloud Console.

1.  **Create or Select a Project:**
    Log in to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and select an existing project or create a new one dedicated to this application.

2.  **Enable Billing:**
    **Crucial:** The Speech-to-Text API will not function (and may not even appear in the library) unless a valid billing account is linked to your project.
    *   Go to the **Billing** section in the main menu.
    *   Link an existing billing account or set up a new one.

3.  **Enable the API:**
    *   Navigate to **APIs & Services > Library**.
    *   Search for **"Cloud Speech-to-Text API"**.
    *   Click on the result and click the **Enable** button. (Note: Enabling this covers both v1 and v2 APIs).

## Step 2: Create a Service Account & Credentials

We need to create a "robot account" with specific permissions to perform transcriptions.

1.  Navigate to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts** in the Cloud Console.
2.  Click **+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT**.
3.  **Service account details:** Enter a name (e.g., `voicemail-transcriber`) and description. Click **CREATE AND CONTINUE**.
4.  **Grant this service account access to project (Important):**
    *   Click the "Select a role" dropdown.
    *   Search for and select the **Cloud Speech Client** role.
    *   Click **CONTINUE**, then click **DONE**.
5.  **Generate the Key:**
    *   Find your new service account in the list. Click the three dots (**Actions**) on the right and select **Manage keys**.
    *   Click **ADD KEY** > **Create new key**.
    *   Select **JSON** and click **CREATE**.
    *   A `.json` file will automatically download to your computer.

> **Security Warning:** This JSON file contains the private key required to access your Google Cloud resources. Keep it secure. Do not commit it to public version control. Open it in a text editor for the next step.

## Step 3: Configuration

We will configure the FS PBX to use the credentials from the JSON file directly from the configuration, without storing the file on the server.

### 1. Update Environment Variables (`.env`)

Open the JSON key file you downloaded in Step 2. You need to copy specific values from this JSON into your `.env` file.

Add the following section to your `.env` file and populate the values. If this section is missing simply add it.

```dotenv
# --- GOOGLE SPEECH-TO-TEXT V2 CREDENTIALS ---
GOOGLE_SPEECH_REGION=us-central1 # Or your preferred region
GOOGLE_SPEECH_MODEL=chirp
# Copy these values directly from your JSON key file
GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id-from-json"
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID="your_private_key_id_from_json"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL="your-client-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id_from_json"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_X509_CERT_URL="your_client_x509_cert_url_from_json"
# For the private key, copy everything between the quotes, including the \n characters,
# and wrap the entire thing in double quotes in your .env file.
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYourKeyHerePart1\nYourKeyHerePart2\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```
### 2. Clear Configuration Cache

If you are using config caching, run the following command to apply the changes:

```bash
cd /var/www/fspbx
php artisan config:cache
php artisan queue:restart
```

## Step 4: Activate the Google Transcription Provider

Once the credentials and configuration are in place, the final step is to instruct the application to use the Google provider for all new voicemail transcriptions.

1.  In the FS PBX user interface, navigate to the **Default Settings** section and then select **Voicemail**.
2.  Locate the setting named `voicemail_queue_strategy`. Update its value to `modern`.
3.  Locate the setting named `transcribe_provider`. Update its value to `google`.
4.  Save the changes.

All new voicemails will now be sent to Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for transcription.

## Troubleshooting

### Checking the Logs

The first place to check for any transcription issues is the main FS PBX log file.

The log is located at: `/var/www/fspbx/storage/logs/laravel.log`

To watch the log file for new errors in real-time, open a terminal on your PBX server and run the following command. Leave this command running while you trigger a new voicemail transcription. Any errors generated by the process will appear in your terminal instantly.

```bash
tail -f /var/www/fspbx/storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### Error: 403 Permission Denied (`speech.recognizers.recognize`)

This indicates the application authenticated successfully, but is not allowed to use the API.

*   **Cause 1:** The **Cloud Speech Client** role was not granted to the Service Account. Go back to IAM in Google Cloud and ensure this role is assigned.
*   **Cause 2:** Billing is not enabled for the project.
*   **Cause 3:** The API is not enabled in the API Library.

### Error: "Failed to fetch Google an access token" or Private Key Errors

This usually indicates an issue with how the credentials were copied to the `.env` file.

*   Ensure the `GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY` in the `.env` file is wrapped in double quotes (`"`).
*   Ensure the entire key, including `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----`, `-----END PRIVATE KEY-----`, and all `\n` characters, was copied exactly from the JSON file.
