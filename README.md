# FS PBX

## Overview

This project started as a fork of the FusionPBX system but has been extensively redesigned. The front end has been redeveloped using Laravel for the backend and Vue.js for the front end. This new implementation aims to enhance user experience, improve performance, and provide a more modern and maintainable codebase.

## Features

- **Laravel Backend**: Robust and scalable backend infrastructure.
- **Vue.js Front End**: Responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Integration with FusionPBX**: Integration with remaining FusionPBX features.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Modern and utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend and maintain.
